# To-Do

- [x] Replace 'MANGOHUD=1' with 'mangohud'
- [x] When adding a new game, if no proton version provided, use the latest available in cache
- [x] If specified proton version not found, download it after asking user for permission
- [x] Fix issue where directories that use "~/" instead of "/home/[user]/" don't work
- [x] change the runner add logic so that I need to mention GE-Proton10-10 instead of just 10-10, etc.
- [ ] Ask user if they want to delete the prefix when removing a game.
- [ ] Improve help messages especially when add a game or creating a prefix.
